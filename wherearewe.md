#1.26.18
#we now have a working compile.js module!

'adam-test-jk.js' is a functional exportable module, which will take as a parameter the name of the 'sourcecode.cpp' file, and create with the batfile 'compilejk.bat'.
note that we are hardcoded with pathing to run on the development server platform!

#what we need

we will eventually need to switch to SDK.

we need to make a run module to 
1.  execute our .exe
2.  pass input parameters
3.  save output

# 1.30.18

1. we need to make callbacks to stagger dependencies between aynsc calls.

2. make .bat files programmatically.

3. 


# 2.2.18

1.  need more effective callbacks.  explored with npm's (async and others), not much success.

2.  we need to go back to basics.  look at the code line by line, refactor, putting more in more breakpoints so that we can understand our codebase better.  and be cleaner!
